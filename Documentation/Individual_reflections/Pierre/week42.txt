As scrum master I'm very happy with the result of our project. The team has matured in the agile work och it's great collaboration that is the key for us to be able to deliver such a good product. Since it's my first time as scrum master I feel that I managed to keep the team to work and help each other to complete the current sprint and also to deal with high risks early in the project. I also think that we used the qualities and knowledge of each member well.
